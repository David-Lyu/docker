Kubernetes: System for running many different containers
  over multiple different machines
  - Run different containers with different images
  - want to use when we have an application that uses many different types
      of containers running at different quantities
  - so the multi-container method can work just depends on the project created


minikube:
  - cmd tool to set up a tiny kubernetes cluster in local machines
  - not used in production

managedSolution:
  - called something different per cloud
  - this is what is used in production

kubectl:
  - anytime we need to tell kubernetes what kind of Node(VM) and its containers
    it should be running
  - use this in production too
  - different than minikube
