code
```docker run -p 8081 : 8080 <image id>```

- 8081 routes incoming request to localhost
- 8080 is the port to go to in the container

```docker run -it dlyu/simpleweb sh```
- lets you open up the shell for the container
- it lets you do standard in for the sh

in docker file COPY doesn't apply the change just yet
